## What AI can do

### Pattern recognition

- Prediction and inference
- Clustering/segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Data generation

### Optimization

AI finds the best possible solution for a problem at a minimum cost, under constraints

- Logistics and delivery: smart routing
- Energy: Power grid operation and control
- Tourism: Flights and hotel pricing
- Marketing: maximum-revenue campaign

### Automation

AI is not automation as most people think, but it helps improve it

- Classifying documents, photos e.t.c
- Job application screening
- Parcel management robots

## Limitations of AI

- Social skills: AI lacks emotional intelligence, empathy, and new, unseen situations
- Bias
- Low data

## Subdomains of AI

- **Machine learning**: Learn from data; prediction, inference
  - **Deep learning**: A subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks, solving the most challenging AI problems
- **Knowledge representation and reasoning**: Communicate with other AI systems
- **Robotics**: Act and manipulate the physical environment
- **Computer vision**: Visually perceiving objects in the environment
- **Natural language processing**: Analyse, understand, communicate human language

## Examples of AI Applications

- Personalized product management - Machine learning
- Warehouse management - Robotics, computer vision, reasoning
- Medical diagnosis - Computer vision, deep learning
- Smart voice assistant - NLP, deep learning

## Related Disciplines

- Data science
- Maths & statistics
- Psychology, physics, ethics, law
